   SELECT m.title, l.name FROM movies m 
   JOIN languages l USING (language_id)
   
2) Show all Telugu movie names (assuming you don't know language
id for Telugu)
  
   SELECT title	FROM movies m 
   LEFT JOIN languages l 
   ON m.language_id=l.language_id
   WHERE l.name="Telugu"

3) Show language and number of movies released in that language
   	SELECT 
            l.name, 
            COUNT(m.movie_id) as no_movies
	FROM languages l
	LEFT JOIN movies m USING (language_id)        
	GROUP BY language_id
	ORDER BY no_movies DESC;


Joining multiple Tables:

1) Generate a report of all Hindi movies sorted by their revenue amount in millions. 
Print movie name, revenue, currency, and unit

	SELECT 
		title, revenue, currency, unit, 
			CASE 
					WHEN unit="Thousands" THEN ROUND(revenue/1000,2)
			WHEN unit="Billions" THEN ROUND(revenue*1000,2)
					ELSE revenue 
			END as revenue_mln
	FROM movies m
	JOIN financials f
			ON m.movie_id=f.movie_id
	JOIN languages l
			ON m.language_id=l.language_id
	WHERE l.name="Hindi"
	ORDER BY revenue_mln DESC
